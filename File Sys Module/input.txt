Use __dirname: To ensure that the file path is correct,
 you can use the __dirname global variable to get the directory of the 
 currently executing script. Modify your code like this:
***********************************
File Extension: In the code you provided, you're trying to read a file named input.txt. 
Make sure that the file is indeed named input.txt and has the correct extension. 
If it's named differently, update the filename in your fs.readFile function.

Check Error Output: The error message you provided mentions Cannot find module 
'./Sport.jsx', which seems unrelated to the code you've posted. 
Verify that there are no typos or mistakes in your command line when running the script.
